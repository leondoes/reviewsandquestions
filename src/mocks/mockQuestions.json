A small portion of our jewelry is considered as nickel-safe meaning that they have micro traces of nickel. What does this mean? Although North America (the United States and Canada) may not have any specific regulation restricting the use the nickel, all jewelers working with Mejuri use metals that are heavily regulated under the EU-REACH registration. This limits the amount of nickel used (micro trace amount), making them unlikely to cause an allergy. For reference, our Single Mini Hoop, along with all of our yellow gold pieces, are in fact nickel-free and should fit super comfortably! Should you experience any kind of reaction, we&#x27;re always here to chat :)",

There&#x27;s a quick fix: can you try gently pushing the clasp part (the side with ridges) outwards with your finger (be sure not to push it too hard) to make a proper circle shape instead of a &quot;6&quot;? The clasp should shut close with a tighter, more secure fit! Feel free to let us know if this works for you :)",
